# actions/expressions

`@actions/expressions` is a library to parse and evaluate GitHub Actions [expressions](https://docs.github.com/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions).

## Installation

The [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actions/expressions) contains TypeScript types and compiled ECMAScript modules.

```bash
npm install @actions/expressions
```

## Usage

### Simple example

```ts
import { Parser, Lexer, Evaluator, data } from '@actions/expressions';

const lexer = new Lexer("1 == 2");
const lr = lexer.lex();

const parser = new Parser(lr.tokens, [], []);
const expr = parser.parse();

const evaluator = new Evaluator(expr, new data.Dictionary());
const result = evaluator.evaluate();

console.log(result.coerceString()) // false
```

### With context data

```ts
import { Parser, Lexer, Evaluator, data } from '@actions/expressions';

const lexer = new Lexer("'monalisa' == context.name");
const lr = lexer.lex();

const parser = new Parser(lr.tokens, ["context"], []);
const expr = parser.parse();

const evaluator = new Evaluator(expr, new data.Dictionary([{
  key: "context"
  value: new data.Dictionary([{
    key: "name"
    value: new data.StringData("monalisa")
  }])
}]));
const result = evaluator.evaluate();

console.log(result.coerceString()) // true
```
